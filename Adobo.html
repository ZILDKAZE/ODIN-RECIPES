    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Adobo is a popular Filipino dish that features meat (usually chicken or pork) cooked in a flavorful vinegar-based sauce. It's a classic Filipino comfort food that's easy to make and packed with savory flavors.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb chicken or pork, cut into serving pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vinegar (preferably cane vinegar or apple cider vinegar)</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 tsp whole peppercorns</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cooking oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaf, and peppercorns. Add the chicken or pork pieces and mix well to coat. Cover and marinate for at least 30 minutes (or up to overnight in the refrigerator).</li>
        <li>Heat the cooking oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Remove the meat from the marinade and reserve the marinade. Sear the meat in the hot oil until browned on all sides.</li>
        <li>Pour the reserved marinade over the meat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until the meat is tender and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and continue simmering, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has reduced and thickened to your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve hot over steamed rice, garnished with sliced green onions or chopped cilantro if desired.</li>
    </ol>
