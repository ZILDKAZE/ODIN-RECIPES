    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough: In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and yeast. Add the warm water and olive oil, and stir until a shaggy dough forms. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: In a small saucepan, combine the crushed tomatoes, basil, oregano, salt, and garlic. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 450째F (230째C) and prepare a pizza pan or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Roll or stretch the dough into a 12-inch circle and transfer it to the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Spread the sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Top with shredded mozzarella cheese and your desired toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven, slice, and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
